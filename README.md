nimum Viable Product (MVP) Specification
Our MVP for the Student Result Checking Portal will focus on delivering core functionality that enables students to view their academic results and teachers to manage result uploads. The key features of this MVP are outlined below:

1. User Roles and Authentication:
Student Login:
Students can log in using a unique username and password.
Passwords will be hashed and securely stored.
Upon successful login, students are directed to their dashboard where they can view their academic results.
Teacher Login:
Teachers can log in using a unique username and password.
After login, teachers are taken to a dashboard where they can upload and manage student results.
Admin Login:
The admin will have a secure login portal where they can manage teacher and student accounts, including registration.
2. User Registration:
Admin-Managed Registration:
Student Registration:
Admins will handle the registration process for students. They will create student accounts by entering necessary details such as name, class, and username.
Students will receive login credentials from the admin.
Teacher Registration:
Admins will also manage the registration of teacher accounts, entering details like name, subject, and username.
Teachers will receive their login credentials from the admin.
3. Teacher Functionalities:
Result Upload:
Teachers will have the ability to upload student results via the portal.
Results can be uploaded for individual students or in bulk using a CSV file.
The system will validate the uploaded data to ensure accuracy and consistency (e.g., correct formatting, no missing values).
Teachers can edit or update previously uploaded results if necessary.
Class and Subject Management:
Teachers can manage the classes and subjects for which they are responsible, ensuring that the results are correctly categorized.
4. Student Functionalities:
View Results:
Upon logging in, students can view their academic results on their dashboard.
The results will be presented in a clear and organized manner, showing grades, subjects, and any additional comments from teachers.
Print Results:
Students will have the option to print their results directly from the portal.
The print layout will be optimized to ensure that all necessary information is clearly displayed.

Additional Considerations for the MVP:
Security:
User data, including login credentials, will be securely stored and encrypted.
Role-based access control (RBAC) will ensure that users can only access the functionalities relevant to their role (e.g., students cannot access result upload features).
User Experience:
The portal will have a simple and intuitive user interface, with clear navigation for all user roles.
Error messages and prompts will be user-friendly and informative, guiding users through any issues they may encounter.
Scalability:
Although the MVP will be a minimal product, the system architecture will be designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the addition of new features and users without significant rework.
